As someone who works in the service industry, tips are my main source of income. This app was created for the main purpose of visualizing a log of the tips I've received. 

The 3 features I've chosen to implement are 
  1) Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application
  2) Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value
  3) Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data

Instructions: click on any white box under a date to enter a number.
